## Provide a brief narrative describing what p-hacking is, and why this is a problematic approach to data analysis.{.tabset}

### Answer{.active}
P-hacking is the term used when scientists artificially represent their results in a significant way. Large data sets always contain significant structures. By data analysis and there especially often by machine learning methods such correlations are specifically searched for, although they have no relevance for the actual application. Therefore, it is important to understand the data in the context of its origin and its natural process.
