# Saving and Loading Data

The chapter conveyed some important tips to reduce the knitting and processing time for the Markdown files with chunk attributes like `echo=FALSE` and `eval=FALSE`. We are able to hide some parts of our code or show code to the reader, without executing it in the background.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap='Screenshot of a code chunk with options explained above'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_eval.png")
```
