Large data sets always contain significant structures. By data analysis and there especially often by machine learning methods such correlations are specifically searched for, although they have no relevance for the actual application. Therefore, it is important to understand the data in the context of its origin and its natural process. 17.4.2 Cartoon ## {-} 17.5 Provide a sketch of your causal understanding of the relationship between temperature and bloom dates. 17.6 What do we need to know to build a process-based model from this?
