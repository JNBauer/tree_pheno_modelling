I can still remember our first lesson, where the question went around how our state of R knowledge is. At that time I already had contact with R several times and also worked with it a lot in the Decision Analysis course, but I still felt like a beginner. Now at the end of this module, after learning so many new things, I don't feel that way anymore. Because of the module, I can now not only transform dataframes to my own needs in various ways, but I have also learned about many new packages and was introduced to the world of dormancy. I am very happy that the module is offered despite the low survivor rate and I think that it could help many people to be much more secure in dealing with R.

Thank you very much!
