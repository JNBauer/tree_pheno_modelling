# Tree dormancy

**1.Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer.**

-   At the moment the Dynamic model is the most sophisticated approach, because of its process based idea [@fad√≥n2020]. This leads on the other hand to more complicated calculations compared to prior methods . Models like the chilling hours are easier to calculate, but do not longer meet the needed requirements. I would recommend the breeder to use the Dynamic model, because of its high reliability. The temperature as only input is the same for all models.

**2.Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlies scales?**

-   covers the whole development of the plant not only the buds as with earlier scales
-   developed in a way that it can suited to all plant species
-   numerical order is more comprehensive

\

**3.Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:** ![Phenological stages of sweet cherry buds](images/03_pheno_stages.png)

1.  54/55

2.  65 could be also lower if the object in the background is a (closed) bud

3.  89

Pictures similar to 1. and 3. can be seen in the appendix of [@fadon_flower_2015].
