# Tree dormancy

## Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods? Please justify your answer.

At the moment the Dynamic model is the most sophisticated approach, because of its process based idea. This leads on the other hand to more complicated calculations compared to prior methods . Models like the chilling hours are easier to calculate, but do not longer meet the needed requirements. I would recommend the breeder to use the Dynamic model, because of its high reliability. The temperature as only input is the same for all models.

## Which are the advantages (2) of the BBCH scale compared with earlies scales?

The BBCH scale covers the whole development of the plant not only the buds as with earlier scales. The second advantage is that the BBCH scale is developed in a way that it can be adapted to all plant species. Additionally the numerical structured order is more comprehensive.

## Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap='Phenological stages of sweet cherry buds'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03_pheno_stages.png")
```

1.  54/55

2.  65 could be also lower if the object in the background is a (closed) bud

3.  89\
